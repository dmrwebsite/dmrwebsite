  Future Home of the Dota master race. The subreddit is currently joining the protest of Reddit administration. Because the site is currently under construction, here is the information for tomorrow (Saturday the 4th, 20:00 UTC games:
  </h1>
  <pre class="center">
	DMR games going on this weekend, Saturday July 4th. We've recently been playing 2-4 games, so if you don't
 make it into a lobby, you can join the teamspeak server, create your own, or hop in on the next game. 

	The game will be streamed this week at <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/r_dotamasterrace">www.twitch.tv/r_dotamasterrace</a>  (hopefully -- 2000Kb/s upload
kind of sucks, but form the short test streams, it doesnt look like it'll lag very much even with the game 
using ~150Kb/s up/down). If the stream starts lagging hard, I also have a backup recording that'll still be 
used for youtube. Any comments for the youtube or twitch would be appreciated.

	The only requirement to be able to play is to be a part of the guild. If you are not yet in the guild, add 
either Twisted (<a href="reddit.com/u/TwistedBOLT">/u/twistedBOLT</a>) or erredece (<a href="reddit.com/u/erredece">/u/erredece</a>) to your steam friendlist so they can add you 
(they use the same nicknames as on reddit).

Teamspeak for the games: Server IP: 176.57.142.3:9988, channel: SOURCE 2 HYPE. No password required.

	Lobby passwords will be given out at the scheduled dmr games time (15:00 CDT) <font color="#290302"> <a href="http://samesa.me/worldclock?t=D20150704T2000&amp;i=tutc,tcst&amp;l=Dota%20Master%20Race%20Games%20-%204th%20July&amp;cd=1">time zone helper</a> </font>

and will be given out to the guild chat, which you see <a href="http://imgur.com/U3PKaLP">here</a>

	Servers: Most users from dmr seem to be in the EU, but depending on the lobby, games can easily be played on
 any server given the majority, or if there's a large size of people that may not be the majority on a 
 different server, then some lobbies may choose to play a game on EU then a game on another server. (thanks 
 <a href="reddit.com/u/CuriousReborn">/u/CuriousReborn</a>) 

	Casters for these games will hopefully include <a href="reddit.com/u/Proud2bTryhard">/u/proud2btryhard</a> (he's the smart one) and myself. (thanks <a href="reddit.com/u/synobal">/u/synobal</a>)

	Feel free to post any questions/concerns about the games as well as anything you might want to see changed 
in the future. Those fo you who keep saying you can't make it to play, let me know why (either PM or here) 
and I'll talk to those that may be able to help you with those issues fixed so we can see some new faces 
and some new raw talent. 

After all, this is where you get gloating powers over those scrubs you beat! To victory!
